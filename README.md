Toy Asynchronous FIFO Generator
=======================

(This repository originated as a submission to CNRV Challenge CH002.)

This project offers an chisel3 reinterpretation of the Verilog code from the well-known article [Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf).
